# TODO for Issue #3190: Add arXiv social icon

## Tasks
- [x] Add `arxiv_id: your_arxiv_id` to `_data/socials.yml`
- [x] Add a new case in `_includes/social.liquid` for `arxiv_id` to create a link with arXiv icon
- [ ] Test the changes (optional, as user can do this)

## Details
- The arXiv social icon should be added to the social icons section.
- Use the existing Academicons icon for arXiv.
- Follow the pattern of other social links in `social.liquid`.
- Testing attempted but Jekyll not installed; changes verified by code review.
