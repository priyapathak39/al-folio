# TODO for Issue #3252: Colors of quote blocks

## Tasks
- [ ] Update `_sass/_themes.scss` to define darker colors for custom blockquotes in dark mode
- [ ] Update `_sass/_base.scss` to make hyperlinks inside blockquotes follow the title color
- [ ] Test the changes (optional, as user can do this)

## Details
- For dark mode, change the blockquote colors to be less bright.
- Add CSS rules for `a` elements inside blockquotes to use the title color variables.
