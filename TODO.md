# TODO: Show More Fields in Publications

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Modify _layouts/bib.liquid to display abstract, award, and video visibly in the main view instead of hidden behind buttons.
  - Remove "hidden" class from abstract, award, and video divs.
  - Move these divs to appear after the periodical section and before the links section.
  - Ensure video embedding is handled properly if enabled.
- [ ] Test the changes by viewing the publications page to confirm more fields are visible.
